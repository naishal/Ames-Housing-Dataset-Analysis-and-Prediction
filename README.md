# Ames-Housing-Dataset-Analysis-and-Prediction
This is my notebook for analyzing and predicting the Ames housing Dataset.
Performed various analysis techniques to find interesting observations about the data.
Also, applied techniques like log-transformation, removing outliers, making models robust against outliers, feature selection etc. to improve 
the performance of linear models on Ames dataset.
